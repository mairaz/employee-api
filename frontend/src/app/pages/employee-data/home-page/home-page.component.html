<p>
    The purpose of this project was to practice the my .NET Core skills by creating a simple application that uses this
    technology.
</p>
<p>This application uses a .NET Core Web API to handle the backend logic and an Angular front-end to display the data.

</p>
<p>The application has the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>View a list of employees</li>
    <li>Add a new employee</li>
    <li>Edit an existing employee</li>
    <li>Delete an employee</li>
</ul>
